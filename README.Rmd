The goal of mdgm is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mdgm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jbcart/mdgm")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(mdgm)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## C++ unit tests

The graph storage data structures implemented in `src/GraphStorage.*` now ship
with standalone C++ unit tests under `tests/cpp`. You can build and execute
them with any C++20 compiler using:

``` bash
make -C tests/cpp
./tests/cpp/graph_storage_tests
```

The `Makefile` links directly against the sources in `src/` so the tests will
always exercise the current implementation.
